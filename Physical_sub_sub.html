	<h1>Physical Health </h1>
	
<P><h3> Asthma 

How? Asthma can be passed down from family members, which would be through genetics or environmental factors. Sometimes it can even be both! 

Symptoms: 

Short of Breath (SOB)
Hard to breathe - your lungs can’t open enough to get a lot of air in 
Coughing 
Wheezing - high-pitched noise because your airways are getting smaller (constricted) 
Feeling chest tightness 

Treatment: 
The treatments are typically prescribed because in asthma it is an internal problem. So, you will most likely have to go to a doctor. 

Nebulizer 
Inhaler 

Non-medication options once you use the medication: 
Exercise 
Diet  </h3></p>
